								<h1>About My Practice</h1>
								<div class="body">
									<p>I wish to provide you with high-quality, personalized psychiatric 
									care and want to work with you collaboratively on the problems you 
									wish to address. The following information may be helpful to you 
									in understanding how I work and how you can make the most of your 
									treatment.</p>
								</div>
								<h1>General Information</h1>
								<div class="body">
									<p>I offer treatment for anxiety and depression problems, utilizing various forms 
									 of psychotherapy and medications when indicated. I try to keep the therapy 
									 understandable and practical. The therapy process takes time, by its nature, but 
									 I try to be active from the start in giving you ideas and feedback about your 
									 situation. I focus on the importance of relationships and interactions with other people, 
									 and how these relate to disturbances in mood. I pay attention to how your past experience 
									 influences the way you view your present situation. I also use some cognitive therapy 
									 concepts, which involve identifying negative thinking patterns and correcting these. If therapy by 
									 itself does not seem to be providing sufficient relief of your symptoms, we will talk 
									 about the use of medications.</p>
									 <p>It is important that we meet at least once or twice a week at the beginning of 
									 treatment so that I can get to know you and understand the problems you are struggling with. 
									 Anything that is on your mind when you come to the session may be useful for us to discuss. 
									 As the treatment progresses, we can evaluate together how frequently we should meet, in order 
									 to achieve your goals and to allow for continued improvement. </p>
									 <p>If you have questions or concerns about your treatment experience with me, please bring 
									 these up during your session. It will aid our working together if you can be very honest 
									 about what has been helpful to you and what has not been helpful.</p>
								</div>
								<h1>Payment/Insurance</h1>
								<div class="body">
									<p>I ask that you be responsible for paying me directly for my services. I participate with CDPHP, MVP, 
									UBH and NYS Empire Plan; for these plans you will owe a co-payment at each visit. Some insurance plans 
									will reimburse participants for a portion of my fee.</p>
								</div>
								<h1>Location</h1>
								<div class="body">
									<p>I am located in New York State's Capital
									District (Albany-Schenectady-Troy), just outside of the 
									Albany city limits. My office is easily accessible 
									from the NYS Thruway and the Northway.
