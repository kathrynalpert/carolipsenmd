								<h1>Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>
								<h3>Notice of Privacy Practices for Protected Health Information</h3>
								<div class="body">
									<p class="privacy">This notice describes how medical information about 
									you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. 
									Please review it carefully.</p>
									<p class="privacy">I am required by law to keep a record of your 
									treatment.  Information about your treatment will ordinarily not be 
									released without your written consent or authorization.  Even with your 
									written permission, I generally send only a treatment summary with 
									relevant information and do not release the entire record.</p>
									<p class="privacy">Federal privacy laws now require that you be 
									informed of possible uses and disclosures of your health information.  
									Listed below are possible uses of your healthcare information for 
									treatment purposes, for payment purposes and for healthcare operations.  
									I will ask you to sign a form acknowledging that you are aware of these 
									possible disclosures. You may request restrictions on the uses of your 
									healthcare information if you wish;  I will let you know whether I can 
									accommodate your request.</p>
									<p class="privacy">Examples of use of your healthcare information 
									for treatment purposes would be:</p>  
									<ul class="privacy">
										<li>I record information in your chart about your treatment.</li>
										<li>I consult with another physician or specialist to obtain his/her
										input on a problem that you are having.</li>
										<li>I phone in a prescription to a pharmacy at your request.  </li>
										<li>I leave a reminder on your answering machine or with a family 
										member about an upcoming appointment. </li>
									</ul>
									<p class="privacy">Examples of use of your healthcare information
									for payment purposes:</p> 
									<ul class="privacy">
										<li>The insurance company requests a diagnosis and procedure
										code in order to process a claim and I provide that 
										information to them.  </li>
										<li>I fill out a treatment plan that the insurance company 
										requires in order to provide coverage of your treatment.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="privacy">Example of use of your healthcare information
									for healthcare operations:</p>
									<ul class="privacy">
										<li>I obtain services from my insurers and consultants such 
										as quality assessment, quality improvement, outcome 
										evaluation, credentialing, medical review, legal services, 
										and insurance.  I may share information about you with such 
										insurers or consultants as necessary to obtain these services. 
										Whenever possible, this information would be shared without 
										any identifying information.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p class="privacy">Other possible disclosures would include:</p>
									<ul class="privacy">
										<li>Using my best judgment, I may disclose to a family 
										member or a close personal friend (or any other person 
										you identify) health information relevant to that person's 
										involvement in your care or in payment for such care 
										if you do not object or in an emergency.  </li>
										<li>To avert a serious danger to health or safety, I may 
										disclose your protected health information to prevent 
										or lessen a serious, imminent threat to the health or 
										safety of a person or the public.  </li>
										<li>I am required to report child abuse and neglect to 
										public authorities by NYS law.  </li>
										<li>As required by law, I may disclose your protected health
										information to public and legal authorities charged with 
										preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability.  </li>
										<li>I may disclose information in the course of any judicial
										or administrative proceeding as allowed or required by law, 
										with your consent, or as directed by proper court order.  </li>
										<li>I may disclose to the FDA your protected health 
										information regarding an adverse event with respect to 
										food, supplements, or product defects to enable recalls.</li>		
									</ul>
									
									<p class="privacy">Any other disclosures will be only as 
									required by law, or will be at your specific request and will 
									require that you sign a specific authorization form. Examples of
									these latter disclosures would be:</p>
									<ul class="privacy">  
										<li>You wish me to provide information regarding your 
										diagnosis and treatment to a new physician with 
										whom you will be entering treatment.  </li>
										<li>You wish me to provide information to an insurance 
										company so they can issue a policy for you.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<h3>Your Health Information Rights</h3>
								<div class="body">
									<p class="privacy">The health and billing records I maintain are
									the physical property of my office. The information in it, 
									however, belongs to you. You have the right to:</p>
									<ul class="privacy">
										<li>Request a restriction on the uses and disclosures of 
										your health information by delivering the request in writing 
										to me. (I am not required to grant the request, unless the 
										requested restriction involves information to be sent to a 
										health plan for payment of health care operations purposes 
										and the disclosure relates to products or services that were
										paid for solely out-of-pocket and such disclosure is not 
										required by law.) I will comply with any request granted.</li>
										<li>Obtain a paper copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices 
										for Protected Health Information, by asking me for this.</li>
										<li>Request that you be allowed to inspect and copy your 
										health and billing record, by delivering a written 
										request to me and scheduling a time with me to review your
										record in my office.  </li>
										<li>Appeal a denial of access to your protected health information.  </li>
										<li>Request that your health care record be amended to 
										correct incomplete or incorrect information by delivering a 
										written request to me. (I am not required to make such amendments.)  </li>
										<li>File a statement of disagreement if your amendment is 
										denied, and require that the request for the amendment and 
										the denial be attached in all future disclosures of your 
										protected health information.  </li>
										<li>Obtain an accounting of disclosures of your health 
										information as required to be maintained by law.  
										An accounting will not include internal uses of information
										for treatment, payment, or operations, disclosures made to
										you or made at your request, or disclosures made to family
										members or friends in the course of providing care.</li>
										<li>Request that communication of your health information
										be made by alternate means or at an alternative 
										location by delivering that request in writing to me.  </li>
										<li>Revoke authorizations that you made previously to use 
										or disclose information except to the extent information
										or action has already been taken by delivering a written 
										revocation to me.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p class="privacy">If you want to exercise any of the above 
									rights, please contact me in person or in writing during normal
									hours. I will give you assistance in how to exercise these rights.
									Additionally, if you believe your privacy rights have been 
									violated, you may file a written complaint to me.  You may 
									also file a complaint by mailing it or e-mailing it to the 
									Secretary of Health and Human Services.  I will not retaliate 
									against you for filing such a complaint.</p>
									<p class="privacy">You have the right to review this Notice 
									before signing the consent authorizing use and disclosure of your 
									protected health information for treatment, payment and 
									healthcare operations purposes.</p>
								</div>
								<h3>Notice of Breach of Health Information</h3>
								<div class="body">
									<p class="privacy">In the unlikely event that your health information is inadvertently 
									acquired, accessed, used by or disclosed to an unauthorized person, I will provide you 
									with written notice of such breach. The notice will be sent without unreasonable delay 
									and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach. The notice will 
									be written in plain language and will contain the following information: (i) a brief 
									description of what happened, the date of the breach, if known, and the date of discovery;
									(ii) the type of PHI involved in the breach; (iii) any precautionary steps you should take;
									(iv) a description of what I am doing to investigate and mitigate the breach and prevent
									future breaches; and (v) how you may contact me to discuss the breach.</p>
									<p class="privacy">The written notice of breach will be sent by regular mail.  If the 
									contact information I maintain for you is insufficient or out-of-date, I may attempt
									to provide notice to you by telephone or other permissible alternate method.  I will 
									also report the breach to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
								</div>
								<h3>My Responsibilities</h3>
								<div class="body">
									<p class="privacy">My office is required to:</p>
									<ul class="privacy">
										<li>Maintain the privacy of your health information as required by law,  </li>
										<li>Provide you with a notice as to my duties and privacy 
										practices as to the information I collect and 
										maintain about you,</li>
										<li>Abide by the terms of this Notice,</li>
										<li>Notify you if I cannot accommodate a requested 
										restriction or request, and</li>
										<li>Accommodate your reasonable requests regarding methods 
										to communicate health information.</li>
									</ul>									
									<p class="privacy">I reserve the right to amend, change, or 
									eliminate provisions in my privacy practices and access practices 
									and to enact new provisions regarding the protected health 
									information.  If my practice changes, I will amend my Notice.  
									You are entitled to receive a revised copy of the Notice by 
									calling and requesting a copy.</p>
									<p class="privacy">If you have questions or would like additional 
									information, please contact me, Dr. Carol Ipsen, at 518-439-5624.</p>
